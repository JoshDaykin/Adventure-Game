After finding some new equipment and potions, you stumble through another door and see something dazzling in the light. It's the chalice!

Unfortunately it's hooked on the belt of a very powerful foe, the leader of the group of bandits is wearing it like a belt buckle.
Luckily since you haven't raised suspicion he has no armour on and his weapon is sheathed.

You need to think fast on what to do:

1)Attack
2)Persuade him to give the chalice back
3)Swipe the chalice from him
4)Exit and save
