Since you weren't spotted at the gate the area seems to be relaxed, no-one is suspect of anything.

Now it seems you have free reign to walk through the compound to find the chalice you've been sent for.
However, you've come to a crossroad. There are 3 paths that you could take, but there is a fairly alert guard sat down in the hall.

Do you?

1)Ask for directions
2)Sneak past and go through a random door
3)Beat the information out of him
4)Exit and save
