After much battle you finally stumble into the final chamber but see that the leader of the bandits is looking straight at you already.
He's clearly been expecting you, since he's armoured up and has his weapon unsheathed. Your eyes scan the room and you notice a lock box, the chalice is probably in there and the key is definitely in his pocket.

How will you deal with this situation?

1)Attack
2)Persuade him to give the chalice back
3)Cause a distraction and swipe the key from him
4)Exit and save
